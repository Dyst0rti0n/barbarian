# Barbarian

Barbarian is a Go library which provides a convenient interface to run your program concurrently,
such as weak password blasting, port scanning, etc.

Inspired by [brutemachine](https://github.com/evilsocket/brutemachine), but I used channel to synchronzing goroutines.

## Installation

`go get -u github.com/Dyst0rti0n/barbarian`
